Scenario 1: Test to delete a product that exists in the repository

Details:
  TestName: deleteExistingProduct
  Description: This test is to check if a product that exists in the repository can be deleted successfully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an existing product when findById is called.
  Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with the id of the existing product.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity's status is OK.
Validation:
  Verify that the product is deleted successfully. The expected result is HttpStatus.OK as the product exists in the repository and should be deleted successfully. This test is significant as it validates the basic functionality of the deleteProduct method.

Scenario 2: Test to delete a product that does not exist in the repository

Details:
  TestName: deleteNonExistingProduct
  Description: This test is to check if the correct response is returned when trying to delete a product that does not exist in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called.
  Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with an id that does not exist in the repository.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity's status is NOT_FOUND.
Validation:
  Verify that the correct response is returned when trying to delete a non-existing product. The expected result is HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND as the product does not exist in the repository. This test is significant as it checks the error handling capability of the deleteProduct method.

Scenario 3: Test to delete a product with a null id

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWithNullId
  Description: This test is to check if the correct response is returned when trying to delete a product with a null id.
Execution:
  Arrange: No need to mock the productRepository as the id is null.
  Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with a null id.
  Assert: Catch the IllegalArgumentException and assert that it is thrown.
Validation:
  Verify that an exception is thrown when trying to delete a product with a null id. The expected result is an IllegalArgumentException as the id cannot be null. This test is significant as it checks the error handling capability of the deleteProduct method when provided with invalid input.

Note: This scenario assumes that the findById method of the productRepository throws IllegalArgumentException when the id is null. If it behaves differently, this scenario may need to be adjusted accordingly.

/*
The test `deleteProductWithNullId` is failing because it's expecting an `IllegalArgumentException` to be thrown when the `deleteProduct` method is called with a `null` argument. But the `deleteProduct` method in the `ProductController` class does not throw this exception when the input is `null`.

From the business logic, when `null` is passed as the id of the product to be deleted, the `findById` method of the `productRepository` returns an `Optional.empty()`. The `orElse` method then returns `ResponseEntity.notFound().build()`. At no point in this process is an `IllegalArgumentException` thrown, which is why the test is failing.

To fix this test, you either need to throw an `IllegalArgumentException` in the `deleteProduct` method when the input is `null`, or change the expected exception in the test to match the actual behavior of the `deleteProduct` method.
@Test
@Tag("boundary")
public void deleteProductWithNullId() {
    assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> {
        productController.deleteProduct(null);
    });
}
