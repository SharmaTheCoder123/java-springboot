"""
  Scenario 1: Test product creation with valid input data

  Details:
    TestName: testCreateProductWithValidInput
    Description: This test is meant to check the creation of a new product using valid input data. The target scenario is when the user provides all the required fields for the product correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new instance of Product with all required fields filled out.
    Act: Invoke the createProduct method with the new product instance as the parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned product against the original one.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the returned product matches the original one in all fields. This confirms that the product was correctly saved in the repository. It is significant as it ensures the application can successfully create new products.

  Scenario 2: Test product creation with missing required fields

  Details:
    TestName: testCreateProductWithMissingFields
    Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the createProduct method when some of the required fields are missing. The target scenario is when the user does not provide all the necessary fields for the product.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new instance of Product with some required fields left empty.
    Act: Invoke the createProduct method with the new product instance as the parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check for an exception.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that an exception is thrown when trying to create a product with missing required fields. This is significant as it ensures the application correctly handles input validation and error handling.

  Scenario 3: Test product creation with invalid field values

  Details:
    TestName: testCreateProductWithInvalidFields
    Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the createProduct method when the input data contains invalid values. The target scenario is when the user provides incorrect values for the product fields.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new instance of Product with invalid field values.
    Act: Invoke the createProduct method with the new product instance as the parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check for an exception.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that an exception is thrown when trying to create a product with invalid field values. This is significant as it ensures the application correctly handles input validation and error handling.

/*
The test `testCreateProductWithMissingFields` is failing because it expects an `IllegalArgumentException` to be thrown when the `createProduct` method is called with a product object that has missing fields. However, the `createProduct` method in the `ProductController` class does not have any checks in place to throw an `IllegalArgumentException` when the product object has missing fields. 

The `createProduct` method simply saves the product object to the `productRepository` without checking if any of the required fields on the product object are missing. This is why no exception is being thrown and the test is failing. 

The error log "Expected java.lang.IllegalArgumentException to be thrown, but nothing was thrown." clearly indicates that the test expected an `IllegalArgumentException` but the method did not throw any. 

Hence, if the business logic requires that all product objects have certain fields, the `createProduct` method should be updated to check for these fields and throw an `IllegalArgumentException` when they are missing. This will ensure the test passes. 

Also, it's important to note that if the fields of the product object are not defined as non-nullable in the database, the save operation might not fail even if they are null. This is because the JPA provider (like Hibernate) or the database might provide default values for missing fields. 

Therefore, to fix this issue, the `createProduct` method should be updated to check for missing fields and throw an `IllegalArgumentException` when they are missing.
@Test
@Tag("invalid")
public void testCreateProductWithMissingFields() {
    Product product = new Product();
    assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> {
        productController.createProduct(product);
    }, "Should throw IllegalArgumentException for missing fields");
}

/*
The test `testCreateProductWithInvalidFields` is failing because it expects an `IllegalArgumentException` to be thrown when a Product with invalid fields is created, but no exception is being thrown.

This issue is arising because the `createProduct` method in the Product Controller, which is being tested here, does not have any validation checks for the input it is receiving. It is directly saving the Product entity to the database without validating the fields.

In the test case, an invalid Product with an empty name and description, and a negative price is created. The test case assumes that an `IllegalArgumentException` will be thrown due to these invalid fields, but since there are no checks in the `createProduct` method, no exception is thrown, causing the test to fail.

To fix this issue, you should add appropriate validation checks in the `createProduct` method to ensure that the input received is valid. If the input is invalid, it should throw an `IllegalArgumentException` or a custom exception. After adding these checks, the test case should pass successfully.
@Test
@Tag("invalid")
public void testCreateProductWithInvalidFields() {
    Product product = new Product();
    product.setName("");
    product.setDescription("");
    product.setPrice(-1.0);
    assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> {
        productController.createProduct(product);
    }, "Should throw IllegalArgumentException for invalid fields");
}
